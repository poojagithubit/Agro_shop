            <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}> Organic farming is agriculture that makes healthy food, healthy soils, 
              healthy plants, and healthy environments a priority, along with crop 
              productivity. Organic farmers use biological fertilizer inputs and 
              management practices such as cover cropping and crop rotation to improve 
              soil quality and build organic soil matter. By increasing the amount of
               organic matter in the soil, organic farmers enhance the soil’s ability 
               to absorb water, reducing the 
              impacts of drought and flooding. Improving soil organic matter also 
              helps it to absorb and store carbon and other nutrients need to grow 
              healthy crops, which, in turn, are better able to resist insects and 
              diseases.

              Organic production systems do not use genetically modified (GM) seed, 
              synthetic pesticides or
              fertilizers. Some of the essential characteristics of organic systems 
              include design and implementation of an organic system plan that 
              describes the practices used in producing crops and livestock products; 
              a detailed recordkeeping system that tracks all products from the field to 
              point of sale; and maintenance of buffer zones to prevent inadvertent 
              contamination by synthetic farm chemicals from adjacent conventional fields</p>

 <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}> The National Organic Program (NOP) develops the rules and regulations for
  the production, handling, labeling, and enforcement of all USDA organic products. This process, referred to
  as rulemaking, involves input from the National Organic Standards Board (a Federal Advisory Committee made up
  of fifteen members of the public) and the public.

  The national standard states that organic food must be produced without the use of conventional pesticides,
  petroleum-based fertilizers, sewage-sludge-based fertilizers, herbicides, genetic enginerring (biotechnology),
  antibiotics, growth hormones, or irradiation. Animals raised on an organic operation must meet animal health
  welfare standards, not be fed antibiotics or growth hormones, be fed 100% organic feed, and must be provided 
  access to the outdoors.* Land must have no prohibited substances applied to it for at least three years
  before the harvest of an organic crop. The NOP states that all farms, ranches, and handling operations that
  display the “USDA Organic” seal must be certified organic by the state or by a private agency, accredited
  by the USDA, to ensure the NOP standards are followed.

  To gain organic certification, a farmer (of cropland, pasture or livestock) submits an organic system plan
  to an accredited certifier each year. This documents how the farmer adheres to NOP standards. Certified
  organic farms and processing facilities undergo annual inspections to verify that they are meeting the 
  standards. Organic inspectors examine all elements of a farm operation for adherence to the standards and
  verfiy that the farm is being managed according to the farmer’s organic system plan.</p>
